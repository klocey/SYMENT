SYnthesized Molecular and Ecological Neutral Theory: A genome based synthesis using simulation models 

Python-based code for a simulation model that induces genetic and ecological random drift in individuals represented by genomes. Output must be analyzed with genomic alignment software (e.g. MOTHUR) which is capable of producing abundance distributions in rank form and of producing output that can be analyzed as a lattic of individuals belonging to different taxa.
